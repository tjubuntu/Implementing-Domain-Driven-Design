### Updating / Manipulating An Entity 更新/使用实体

Once an entity is created, it is updated/manipulated by the use cases until it is deleted from the system. There can be different types of the use cases directly or indirectly changes an entity.

In this section, we will discuss a typical update operation that changes multiple properties of an Issue.

This time, beginning from the Update DTO:

By comparing to IssueCreationDto, you see no RepositoryId. Because, our system doesn't allow to move issues across repositories (think as GitHub repositories). Only Title is required and the other properties are optional.

Let's see the Update implementation in the IssueAppService:

- UpdateAsync method gets id as a separate parameter. It is not included in the UpdateIssueDto. This is a design decision that helps ABP to properly define HTTP routes when you auto expose this service as an HTTP API endpoint. So, that's not related to DDD.
- It starts by getting the Issue entity from the database.
- Uses IssueManager's ChangeTitleAsync instead of directly calling Issue.SetTitle(...). Because we need to implement the duplicate Title check as just done in the Entity Creation. This requires some changes in the Issue and IssueManager classes (will be explained below).
- Uses IssueManager's AssignToAsync method if the assigned user is being changed with this request.
- Directly sets the Issue.Text since there is no business rule for that. If we need later, we can always refactor.
- Saves changes to the database. Again, saving changed entities is a responsibility of the Application Service method that coordinates the business objects and the transaction. If the IssueManager had saved internally in ChangeTitleAsync and AssignToAsync method, there would be double database operation (see the Discussion:Why is the Issue not saved to the database in IssueManager? above).
- Finally uses the IObjectMapper to return an IssueDto that is automatically created by mapping from the updated ssue entity.

As said, we need some changes in the Issue and IssueManager classes.

First, made SetTitle internal in the Issue class:

Then added a new method to the IssueManager to change the Title:
